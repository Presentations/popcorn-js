# Popcorn Googlemap Plug-in #

## Purpose ##

Adds a map to the target div centered on the location specified by the user.

## Options ##

* Start [Number]: The time you want the Googlemap to appear.
* End [Number]: The time you want the Googlemap to be hidden.
* Target [String]: Target is the id of the DOM element that you want the map to appear in. This element must be in the DOM
* Type [String, optional]: either: HYBRID (default), ROADMAP, SATELLITE, TERRAIN, STREETVIEW
* Zoom [Number, optional] defaults to 0
* Heading [Number, optional] STREETVIEW orientation of camera in degrees relative to true north (0 north, 90 true east, ect)
* Pitch [Number, optional] STREETVIEW vertical orientation of the camera (between 1 and 3 is recommended)
* Lat [Number]: The Latitude that the map should be centered on.
* Lng [Number]: The Lopngitude hat the map should be centered on. (NOTE: Lat and Lng bust be specified if no Location is provided.)
* Location [String]: An address/location to center the map on. Must be present if lat and lng are not specified.

> Note: using location requires extra loading time, also not specifying both lat/lng and location will
cause and error.

## Tweening ##

Tweening animates a streetview from one location to another.

* Location [String]: The start point when using an auto generated route
* Interval [Number]: is the speed in which the tween will be executed, a reasonable time is 1000 ( time in milliseconds )
* Heading, Zoom, and Pitch streetview values are also used in tweening with the autogenerated route (see above)
* Tween [Object]: An array of objects, each containing data for one frame of a tween
* Position [Object] An object with two keys, lat and lng, both which are mandatory for a tween to work
* Pov [Object]: An object which houses heading, pitch, and zoom paramters, which are all optional, if undefined, these values default to 0
