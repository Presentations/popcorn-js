cue( time, callback )
=====================

cue is an alias to exec(), meaning it provides the same functionality but is simply accessed through a seperate function name.  Cue was created with film makers in mind by using a familiar keyword in order to make developing Popcorn.js projects simpler.

* **time** - the time in which the cue will be fired at
* **callback** - a callback function that will be executed at a given **time** in a cue

Examples

Cue is used in the exact same fashion as exec:
